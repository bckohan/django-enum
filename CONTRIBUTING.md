# Contributing

Contributions are encouraged! Please use the issue page to submit feature requests or bug reports. Issues with attached PRs will be given priority and have a much higher likelihood of acceptance. Please also open an issue and associate it with any submitted PRs. That said, the aim is to keep this library as lightweight as possible. Only features with broad based use cases will be considered.

We are actively seeking additional maintainers. If you're interested, please contact [me](https://github.com/bckohan).


## Installation

### Install Just

We provide a platform independent justfile with recipes for all the development tasks. You should [install just](https://just.systems/man/en/installation.html) if it is not on your system already.

`django-enum` uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv) for environment, package and dependency management:

```shell
    just install_uv
```

Next, initialize and install the development environment:

```shell
    just setup
    just install
```

## Documentation

`django-enum` documentation is generated using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org). Any new feature PRs must provide updated documentation for the features added. To build the docs run:

```shell
    just install-docs
    just docs
```

## Static Analysis

`django-enum` uses [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff) for python linting and formatting. [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org) is used for static type checking. Before any PR is accepted the following must be run, and static analysis tools should not produce any errors or warnings. Disabling certain errors or warnings where justified is acceptable:

```shell
    just check
```

## Running Tests

`django-enum` uses [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to define and run tests. All the tests are housed under ``tests/``. Before a PR is accepted, all tests must be passing and the code coverage must be at 100%. A small number of exempted error handling branches are acceptable.

To run the full suite:

```shell
    just test
```

To run a single test, or group of tests in a class:

```shell
    just test <path_to_tests_file>::ClassName::FunctionName
```

For instance to run all tests in ExampleTests, and then just the
test_color example test you would do:

```console
    just test tests/test_examples.py::ExampleTests
    just test tests/test_examples.py::ExampleTests::test_color
```

## RDBMS

By default, the tests will run against postgresql so in order to run the tests you will need to have a postgresql server running that is accessible to the default postgres user with no password. The test suite can be run against any RDBMS supported by Django. Just set the ``RDBMS`` environment variable to one of:

  * postgres
  * sqlite
  * mysql
  * mariadb
  * oracle

The settings for each RDBMS can be found in ``tests/settings.py``. The database settings can be altered via environment variables that are referenced therein. The default settings are designed to work out of the box with the official docker images for each RDBMS. Reference the github actions workflow for an example of how to run the tests against each RDBMS using docker containers.

Additional dependency groups will need to be installed for some RDBMS, to run the full suite against a given RDBMS, set the ``RDBMS`` environment variable and run test-all with the appropriate db client argument.

```shell
    just test-all  # sqlite tests
    just test-all psycopg3  # for postgres using psycopg3
    just test-all psycopg2  # for postgres using psycopg2
    just test-all mysql  # for mysql or mariadb
    just test-all oracle  # for oracle
```

## Issuing Releases

The release workflow is triggered by tag creation. You must have [git tag signing enabled](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). Our justfile has a release shortcut:

```shell
    just release x.x.x
```
